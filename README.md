## Description

This project focuses on analyzing out-of-home purchase behaviors of French households. The study is based on a sample of 3,338 households,
and the analysis involves data adjustment (redressing) using sociodemographic criteria, such as the occupation of the head of the household, 
the age of the head of the household, the number of people in the household, the region of residence, and the urban category.


## Parts of the Project
### Part 1 

1.  Introduction:
    Provides an overview of the sampling process, data adjustment (redressing), and extrapolation. 
    Explains the importance of these steps and justifies the choice of sociodemographic criteria.

2. Extrapolation of the Survey: Utilizes sociodemographic criteria (CSPCHEF, AGECHEF, REGION, NBPERS, TU) to estimate survey results for the entire population.

3. Survey Data Processing:** Conducts univariate and bivariate analyses through cross-tabulation and flat tables.

4. Significance Testing on Modalities:
   Measures the association between reported responses and sociodemographic criteria. 
   Characterizes the results using univariate analysis.

### Part 2 

5. Exploring Multivariate Characteristics of Response Modalities:
   Utilizes the CHAID algorithm to explore multivariate characteristics of response modalities.
